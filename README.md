## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle.

- **Images are categorized into two classes: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA.**
- The dataset is already split into `train`, `test`, and `val` directories.

_Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size. Please download it from the link above and place it in the `data/` folder._

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone
   ```
